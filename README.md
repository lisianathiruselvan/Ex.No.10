# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date:
## Reg. No. 212222240101

## Aim:
To demonstrate how prompt patterns such as query decomposition, decision-making prompts, answer engineering, semantic filtering, fact-check lists, tail generation, and menu-based prompting can be used to generate structured, creative, and high-quality content such as reports, stories, and case studies. The experiment aims to show how prompt structure directly affects output coherence, accuracy, and depth.

## Procedure:

1. **Introduction to Prompt Patterns**
   The following prompting techniques were studied and applied:
   • Query Decomposition
   • Decision Making
   • Answer Engineering
   • Fact Check List
   • Tail Generation
   • Menu Actions
   • Semantic Filtering

2. **Selection of Content Types**
   Two scenarios were selected from the provided list:
   • Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story
   • Educational Report on Renewable Energy

3. **Initial Prompt Creation**
   Simple prompts were used to generate first drafts. No advanced structure or constraints were imposed initially.

4. **Refinement Stage**
   Advanced prompting techniques were introduced:
   • Breaking the query into components (characters, conflict, ending)
   • Adding style instructions (formal, cinematic, academic)
   • Asking the model to choose between plot directions
   • Extending the story logically (tail generation)
   • Structuring reports into sections using answer engineering

5. **Iteration & Evaluation**
   The generated outputs were evaluated for clarity, coherence, creativity, tone, and factual accuracy.
   Based on evaluation, prompts were improved and new refined drafts were generated.

6. **Observation through Test Scenarios**
   Multiple versions were created for each scenario to observe changes caused by prompt variations.

7. **Final Output Compilation**
   The polished versions of both selected scenarios were prepared and included in the final experiment record.

## Test Case Scenario 1: Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story

## FIRST DRAFT (Simple Prompt Output)

Prompt: “Write a short sci-fi story about space travel.”

## Output:
In the year 2450, humans traveled across galaxies. Captain Aira led a mission to explore a new planet, Veron. They discovered glowing plants and floating rocks. A signal from underground warned of a cosmic storm. Aira sent the warning to Earth and saved millions before escaping.

## REFINED CONTENT (Using Query Decomposition, Tone Filtering, Tail Generation)

### Prompt Techniques Used:
• Break story into setting, characters, conflict, twist
• Cinematic emotional tone
• Extend story with a logical ending

### Refined Story:
By 2450, humanity had mastered interstellar travel, but the galaxy still held mysteries. Captain Aira Solen and her crew landed on Veron-6, a world filled with violet skies and bioluminescent forests. Deep underground, they found an alien memory core containing a warning: a dark-matter storm was spreading. Aira transmitted this data, enabling mass evacuations across seven planets. As Veron-6 collapsed into the storm, Aira realized that an extinct civilization had saved humanity one last time.

## MULTIPLE VERSIONS (Demonstrating Prompt Effects)

1. Decision-Making Version
   Ending chosen by AI based on prompt: hopeful or dark.
   • Hopeful: The storm is stopped by alien technology.
   • Dark: The storm continues and spreads.

2. Semantic Filter Version
   Tone changed to humorous and light-hearted.

3. Branching (Menu Action) Version
   Options:
   (A) Explore ruins
   (B) Decode alien core
   (C) Escape planet
   Each option produced a different storyline.

## FINAL POLISHED VERSION

### Final Sci-Fi Story:

In 2450, Captain Aira Solen investigated Veron-6, a planet emitting mysterious quantum pulses. Beneath its glowing forests, she discovered an alien archive warning of a destructive dark-matter storm. Her transmission triggered a life-saving multi-planet evacuation. As Veron-6 vanished into the storm, Aira realized that even civilizations long gone can change the fate of the living.


## Test Case Scenario 2: Educational Report on Renewable Energy

## FIRST DRAFT (Simple Prompt Output)

Prompt: “Write a report on renewable energy.”

## Output:
Renewable energy comes from sunlight, wind, and water. It reduces pollution and is important for sustainability. Solar and wind are widely used. Renewable energy helps fight climate change.

## REFINED CONTENT (Using Answer Engineering, Fact-Check List, and Semantic Filtering)

## Refined Report:
Introduction
Renewable energy comes from sources that naturally replenish, such as sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat. These sources are cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.

Types of Renewable Energy
• Solar Power
• Wind Power
• Hydropower
• Biomass
• Geothermal Energy

Importance
Renewable energy reduces emissions, supports energy security, and promotes sustainable economic growth.

Challenges
• High installation cost
• Weather-dependent power generation
• Need for better storage systems

Future Trends
Improvements in energy storage, hydrogen fuels, and smart grids will expand renewable energy adoption globally.

## MULTIPLE VERSIONS (Prompt-Based Variations)

1. Decision-Making Version
   Prompt: Focus on (A) Solar (B) Wind (C) Hydropower
   Output: Individual sub-reports based on chosen focus.

2. Simplified Tone Version
   Prompt: “Rewrite for high-school students.”

3. Structured Breakdown Version
   Prompt: “Divide the report into introduction, benefits, challenges, and future developments.”

## FINAL POLISHED VERSION

Final Educational Report:
Renewable energy provides sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels by harnessing sunlight, wind, geothermal heat, and water flow. As the need for clean energy grows, renewable systems help reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, and support global energy independence. Despite challenges involving cost and intermittency, advancements in storage, green hydrogen, and grid modernization are accelerating adoption. In the future, renewable energy will play a major role in powering industries, homes, and transportation, contributing to a more resilient and environmentally responsible world.


## Conclusion:
This experiment demonstrates that the quality, depth, and structure of AI-generated content heavily depend on how prompts are designed. By applying prompt patterns such as query decomposition, decision-making prompts, semantic filtering, and answer engineering, outputs can be significantly improved in coherence, creativity, factual accuracy, and engagement. This proves that well-structured prompting is essential for generating professional-quality reports, articles, and creative writing using AI tools.
